# Define a single subsampling scheme for the state of Idaho.
# This analysis is for a specific date range, so we specify
# the same maximum collection date for strains in all sections
# of the subsampling scheme below.
subsampling:
  orchid_scheme:
    # Include all data from ORCHID.
    # When the workflow merges metadata from multiple
    # inputs, it creates a boolean column for each input to
    # indicate which input each record came from. A record
    # from the "asia" input will have a value of "yes" in a
    # column named "asia". The same record will have a column
    # for the "nextregions" input with a value of "no".
    custom_sample:
      query: --query "(custom_data == 'yes')"
      # Limit the number of ORCHID records included in the
      # analysis to a reasonable but large number. Tune this
      # number alone with the other "max_sequences" in the
      # sections below to keep your final build to <10,000
      # records.

    # To understand transmission patterns within the US that
    # led to introductions to Idaho, we select a subset of USA
    # data from states other than Idaho with priority given to

    # the "idaho" subsampling set defined above.
    Indonesia_context:
      query: --query "(custom_data != 'yes') & (country == 'Indonesia')"

      # your needs for the resulting tree.
      max_sequences: 20
      # These group-by columns attempt to evenly sample across
